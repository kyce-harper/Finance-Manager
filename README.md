The Goal Here is to create a better version of my current financial Management plan. I use google sheets to track everything and I want to put it into code for pusrpose of gathering the data more closley to
create trends, and make insights about my finances and have more automation and customization on how wverything is stored. I am making it in C++ initially to practice since its the main
language used in my university classes. I also know there is a lot of ways to make optimizations to make the program super effieient and C++ being more lower level than python and other
popular ones might provide an edge of making this superlightweight and effiecient while I learn optimization theory stuff.
